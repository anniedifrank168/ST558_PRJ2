# ST558_PRJ2

A note on commits: I don't have the required amount of commits because I wasn't realizing until really late on that my commits were not going through because of my data file being way too big (because i'm a dummy). 

This repo is for project 2 of stat558. I've used version 4 (2009-2017) rather than version 5 (2009-2018) of the NFL play-by-play dataset just due to the storage amount (v5 was about twice as big).

The purpose of this app is to analyze conversion rates of 4th and short (which I define as less than or equal to 2 yrds) and 2-point attempts. I've designed the app with seperate tabs for the exploratory data analysis, including a numerical summaries section to see mean/median/sd for user-supplied numeric variables at different values of the 'posteam' variable (NFL teams), tables and plots on 2 pt conversion rates, tables and plots on 4th and short conversion rates, line plots to visualize multiple teams, and an interactive plot to see both types of conversion rates for selected teams.
